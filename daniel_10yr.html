            <p>When Andrew was called Home to Jesus on June 25th 1997 we cut out a
            calendar clipping for that exact date just to add to our ‘Andrew memories’.
            This is what it says …</p>
            <p>“Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain
            understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard”<br>
            Daniel 10 v 12.</p>
            <p>Though called home before the answer comes, with clearer vision you may see
            how your heart-cry has been heard and answered in a way least expected.</p>
            <p>Unanswered yet? No, do not say ungranted;</p>
            <p>Perhaps your part is not yet wholly done;</p>
            <p>The work began when first your prayer was uttered,</p>
            <p>And God will finish what He has begun.</p>
