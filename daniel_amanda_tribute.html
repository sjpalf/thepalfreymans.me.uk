            <p>The very first time I met Dan we had an instant connection. We felt as though we’d known each other our whole lives. It truly was love at first sight!</p>
            <p>From that day onwards we were inseparable. He was so perfect in everyway; I didn’t ever dream somebody like that existed. We loved and protected each other and cherished every moment we had together. We knew our love was unique. Never have two people been more right for each other. I just loved everything about him, as he did me and not a day went by when we didn’t tell each other. Everyone he spoke to instantly warmed to his bubbly personality and his huge smile he had constantly!!</p>
            <p>He made me the happiest girl alive; we were so excited about spending the rest of our lives together. We truly believed God had brought us together to bring each other true love and happiness like no other.</p>
            <p>But God can work in mysterious ways and so we must come to terms with that it was Dan’s time to go, however unfair it seems. At least we both have had the happiest year of our lives which I will treasure in my heart forever!!</p>
