            <p><strong>2nd February 2009</strong></p>
            <p>To dear Cilla, Julian, Stephen and Ben</p>
            <p>in loving memory of Daniel.</p>
            <p>Our beloved Daniel was like a younger brother to us and a big play friend to Kristina. He touched our hearts in a way we cannot express. We adored him for his childlike qualities, infectious smile and laid back approach to life.</p>
            <p>We loved the way he casually turned up at the doorstep as though we were expecting him for dinner, but happily invited him in to join us!</p>
            <p>Kristina always got excited by the mere mention of Daniel's name, as she knew she would have a play friend for the duration of his visit and an accomplice to some naughty antics.</p>
            <p>I told Daniel off countless times for teaching Kristina bad habits, like playing ball in the living room and trying to hang a spoon on the end of her tongue to name but a few. But apart from these little antics Daniel was a sweet and innocent young man, who would never harm anyone intentionally.</p>
            <p>Even though Daniel had been through many personal hardships, more than his fair share, he was never bitter and never gave up on his faith.</p>
            <p>In fact his faith was strengthened and the Lord rewarded him with a beautiful and happy last year on this earth with his beloved fiancée Amanda before taking him to heaven.</p>
            <p>Daniel was a loving, caring, happy and giving Christian young man and although we miss his joyful presence we have true comfort in the knowledge that he is with his Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Thankyou for the memories Daniel</p>
            <p>Love always</p>
            <p></p>Robert, Susie and little Kristina</p>
            <p>Lamentations 3 v 22-23, 31-33</p>
            <p>The faithful love of the Lord never ends! His mercies never cease.</p>
            <p>Great is His faithfulness; His mercies begin afresh each morning.</p>
            <p></p>...</p>
            <p>For no one is abandoned by the Lord forever. Though He brings grief, He also shows compassion because of the greatness of His unfailing love.</p>
            <p>For He does not enjoy hurting people or causing them sorrow.</p>
            <p>Philippians 4 v 4-5</p>
            <p>Always be full of joy in the Lord. I say it again—rejoice!</p>
            <p>Let everyone see that you are considerate in all you do.</p>
            <p></p>Remember, the Lord is coming soon!</p>
            <p>2nd February 2009</p>
            <p>"…please be assured that Dan and your family are often in our thoughts and I will always treasure the memories..."</p>
