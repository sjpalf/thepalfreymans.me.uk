            <h3>The testimony of 'K'</h3>
            <br>
            <p><strong>one of Cilla's friends who lives in the United States of America</strong></p>
            <p>I was five years old when my mother spoke of Jesus to me and my brother. I said a little prayer, not really knowing anything much other than thinking Jesus was a nice man. It wasn't until years later, when I was eleven that I got saved.</p>
            <p>My family went to church off and on during this time when I was growing up - both are born-again Christians. We went to an evening service where my church showed a movie about the end times. On our way home in the car, I thought about the time my mom had told me and my brother about Jesus, and I asked my dad if I was saved. My dad told me that only I could answer that question!</p>
            <p>I was afraid...the movie had such a traumatic impact on me..seeing a girl getting beheaded for her beliefs!</p>
            <p>In my bedroom that night, I frankly told God that I accepted Christ, and then went to go to sleep, but something inside told me that that wasn't enough, that I needed to repent of my sins. But what did I do? What were my sins? Me being called a sinner seemed so strange to me....I had to literally think...okay..what did I do wrong? I believed I was a sinner, on the basis of God's Word, but I had to try to remember things I had done wrong. A few minutes went by and then I remembered fighting with my brother, then another sin came to mind. After seeing that I had sinned, I prayed and told God that I was a sinner, asked His forgiveness, and that I received Jesus into my heart. I then asked Jesus to save me.</p>
            <p>I knew then, after praying that prayer that if Jesus was to come back that night, that I would be taken along with my parents. I was very relieved.</p>
            <p>A few minutes later, I prayed and thanked God for saving me...it was like praying to my Father..because He is, through Christ, my Heavenly Father. I looked out of my bedroom window that night, and looked at the stars, trees, and other things outside. They all seemed to witness of His glory. I also started to feel homesick...</p>
            <p>Sometimes even now, I pray and ask God that He would go ahead and send Jesus for us...sometimes I hear bad news and it does make me cry - wishing and praying for Jesus to come back.</p>
            <p>My husband and I pray that the Lord will come back for us Christians during our lifetimes - that none of our family will see death 'till He returns. My husband and children are saved, too.</p>
            <p>I'm thankful for my salvation...I'm thankful for God's Word. I'm thankful for the little spiritual lessons the Lord teaches me from time to time through His Word and through nature itself - when I least expect it. I'm thankful for His love and mercy.</p>
