            <p><strong>Really alive</strong></p>
            <p>My salvation took many years and is rather complicated.
            </p>
            <p>After my father died, my mother had a psychotic break and took it out on me. She was very verbally and emotionally abusive. I have had problems with depression most of my life. I felt that I wanted to be with my father and I attempted suicide, was found and ended up in the hospital. My children, who were raised as Christians and were teenagers came and witnessed to me. At that point I was willing to listen to anything. I said, since I was Jewish I would have to find a Jewish/Christian congregation. I didn't do anything right away except listen to some tapes my children gave me. About six weeks later I was very depressed and crying. I looked in the phone book and found a messianic congregation. I called and went to see one of the elders the same day. He gave me my first Bible and I started reading it. I got involved with the church, trying very hard to believe.
            </p>
            <p>During the time I went to the congregation I tried crossing the bridge from Judaism and Christianity even though all of the Jewish heritage, festivals and holy days were included. During the first year and a half, I continued grieving terribly for my father. I kept attempting suicide and since I always lived, I felt that even God didn't want me. The most serious was on my father's grave and I was hypothermic at 69 degrees internal temperature. Miraculously, I even lived through that one having had respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. That has happened several times and I know ending my life is not for me to decide. I finally saw that God wanted me here. I didn't have a problem believing in God, but in Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>I eventually joined the church, with some pushing on the Pastor's part and also got baptized again with some pushing. I said the words, but didn't really believe.
            </p>
            <p>During the ensuing years, the late 80's to mid 90's I went to several different churches with my daughter, in New Mexico and here in New York. A couple of them were actually cults, but we didn't know that at the time. I was still trying very hard to believe. I studied the Bible, but with my intellect and not my heart. When my daughter left New York, I quit going to church and gave up on Christianity.
            </p>
            <p>In September 2002, I felt totally spiritually lost. I live in the country, have no close neighbors and don't know anyone around here. I have no friends, except on-line. I went searching for Bibles, bulletin boards, Bible lessons and many other areas of Christianity.
            </p>
            <p>I went to a church about 30 miles from here and then found another one closer. On September 29,2002, I irrevocably gave my life to Jesus, asked His forgiveness of my sins and found my salvation in Him. I did this totally on my own, except for my daughters continuously praying for me. There was something else that powerfully affected me and convicted me to stay forever with Yeshua. It was a movie called "Jesus" that a friend said I should see. I have to say that I am forever thankful for her and her suggestion. I saw it twice and cried many times. For me it wasn't just a movie, but a real testimony about Christ and my relationship with Him.
            </p>
            <p>I looked in the Rochester, NY phone book and found a messianic congregation there (it's about 70 miles from me). I have been wanting to go to church for 2 and Â½ months. The weather here has been so bad, snowed in most of the time, that it aways seems to be on the weekends that the most snow falls. I have a 300-foot driveway and have to dig my way down to the end and then shovel out what the snowplow has piled up. Sometimes it has been so deep and frozen that it totally covers up the truck. So I keep praying for less snow so I can go to church.
            </p>
            <p>I am very grateful to have found the BibleDataBase Christian Message Board. I asked questions, reply to topics and have made a some friends. I am convicted in my faith and I know this time I won't leave. I know the truth and the truth has set me free.
            </p>
            <p>I am also disabled and among other things I have fibromyalgia, so many days the best I can do is get through the day, though it seems that I have gotten a little better since I gave my life to Jesus. I feel very blessed and now I can talk openly to my daughter (who is also disabled from a congenital brain tumor) about my faith and she helps me a lot and I always pray for her along with many others. I sometimes feel sad that it took so long, but most of the time I am joyful that I finally found the Lord.
