            <p>I was baptised as a baby, and confirmed as a teenager in the Lutheran Church. I then ignored God, Jesus, and church for about 20 years. To be honest it wasn't until I began reading the "Left Behind" series that I even started thinking about God in my life. I never denied the existence of God, and I never doubted God's love and Jesus's sacrifice, I just had too many other "important" things to do! I've learned now just how scary a position I had put myself in. Statistically speaking, I probably only have another 40 years left of life on this earth, but then I'll be spending all of eternity somewhere... If I had some kind of accident before realigning my life to Jesus, I shudder to think where that somewhere would have been!
            </p>
            <p>I consider myself to be a baby christian, I have a lot to learn, and try to read my Bible and pray daily. I want to figure out what God intended me to be and do, right now I'm not sure. I do know that I want to walk with the Lord, and let Him sit in the drivers seat wherever I should go.
