            <p><strong>Saved on the Road</strong></p>
            <p>First of all here is some of my background. I was born into a mennonite home where my parents taught me that God exists and that is about the knowledge I had of Him except that I would pray before meals and all that. However they never told me about The Lord Jesus Christ and having my sins forgiven.</p>
            <p>So I went on through life and I was never in trouble or anything, but I always kept everything i did from my parents. I had an active imagination but I would use it to dream up ways to escape reality. Basically this was going on my whole life 'til I met my friend who was saved only three years before i met him. We started hanging out almost every day except he would never be around all day and every wednesday night. I asked him why and he said he was going to a gospel meeting and asked if I wanted to come with. I always quickly refused and went home. So I started going with my parents to church and it just so happens that I couldn't understand german and so I never got a single thing out of those sermons (which is probably a good thing). So I stopped going and would hide from my parents every sunday morning so i wouldnt have to go to church.</p>
            <p>I still hung out with my Christian friend and one day he asked me if I wanted to go to a gospel meeting in a tent. So after a while he finally convinced me to go. I went and heard nothing but was amazed at how friendly the preachers were there. And then I met a few more people who went to that place and became friends with them so it kept me coming and listening to the gospel that was being preached. Eventually the tent meetings stopped but then they had bought a building about 15 minute drive from my house. So I would come every day there was a meeting, and yet I still wasn't saved. I went to the youth group on friday and memorized John chapter 3 and yet i still didnt get the message.</p>
            <p>After a while I knew that I have to be saved so I thought I'm going to get saved by a verse in the bible that I would randomly flip to. It was in Leviticus and all I saw was a part of the law which I never fulfilled. So I kept going and actually I never read the bible until I was 16 years old and for that matter never even had a bible. But anyways I kept going to the gospel hall and just kept getting asked if I got saved yet and I would always reply that I didn't know. They always said afterwards that if I don't know I'm saved it probably means I'm not. So I would get concerned but the just push it to the back of my mind. Until one day.</p>
            <p>It was a Thursday, May 1st of 2003. I was at my friends house and decided to go home. He only lives around 2 KMs away from my house so I picked up my skateboard and started to go home. I looked outside only to see a huge storm coming in and thunder and lightning everywhere. I got on my skateboard and started going about as fast as I could and it was going good until I had about 3/4 of a kilometer left and then I couldn't go anymore. I wore off all my energy until I could not even skateboard anymore. So I picked it up and started walking frantically until I saw a bolt of lightning hit the ground about 100 meters away (300 feet). It stopped me dead. I could feel the heat and my mind started racing with questions like what if that was 100 feet closer, and where would I be when I die. The answer came into my head as quickly as that bolt of lightning, HELL. I would have been in Hell if I had died that moment.</p>
            <p>Over and over it sounded in my head until I thought of a verse I learnt before in sunday school which says, "For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly" Romans 5:6. Then my mind started to give me flashbacks where I remember lying, cheating, stealing and everything else I did wrong. Then it hit me that I am ungodly. So I realized that if Christ died for the ungoldy, then he died for me. Nothing to doubt, and nothing to do except believe on what he has done. And that is how God reached and saved my soul from the blackness of darkness forever.</p>
